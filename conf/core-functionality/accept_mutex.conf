  # three kind of related settings: accept_mutex on; accept_mutex off; reuseport;
  # accept_mutex on: there is lock, every worker will try to get it(but not blocked), if failed, wait accept_mutex_delay time.
  # SO_REUSEPORT Option (in listen directive) on : the system will assign the connection to one of listening sockets(linux 3.9+)
  # accept_mutex off:Once there is a new connection, all processes(all listeners) will try to get it(Thundering_herd_problem)

  # Turn accept_mutex off to improve the performance(use wrk to verify it)
